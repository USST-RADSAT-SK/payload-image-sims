1. SVD + Wavelet transform

In PHYS 893 we used singular value decomposition to change the resolution of an image.

Singular value decomposition is used to break a matrix (=image) up into its "principal components". These are essentially the vectors that contain the information needed to reconstruct the matrix.
Often only the first few components contain the majority of the important information, so the image resolution can be decreased by discarding the less important components. 

It looks like a combination of SVD and Wavelet transforms can be used to increase the constrast of an image (so not exactly the resolution...)
A wavelet transform is basically a 2d fourier transform. It shows how the fundamental frequencies of the signal vary over time.

I haven't looked at the math closely, but I am very familiar with both SVD and Wavelet transforms, and have working python code for both that I can share with the group.

2. Image interpolation

Interpolated between pixels to provide the extra resolution.
Very easy to do with scipy (https://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/image_processing/).

3. Using wavelets for image interpolation

For image enhancement purposes it looks like the wavelet transform is used to break the signal (the image) into four different "frequency" bands.
The the highest frequency image is used to interpolate the input low resolution image.
This new image is then combined back with the other frequency components to get the final result.

4. Machine Learning

I don't know much about this but it gives nice results.

A comparison of various image enhancement algorithms. The best one would depend on what our end goal is.
